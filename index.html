          History and Inspiration
        </h1>

        <p>
          This project is inspired and draws heavily from Andy Harris'
          <a href="http://aharrisbooks.net/h5g">simpleGame.js</a>.
          Andy was my introductory Computer Science professor at
          <a href="http://iupui.edu">IUPUI</a>. Over the course of
          a semester I had an opportunity to work with Andy along
          with some of my fellow students using his simpleGame.js engine.
          I have played video games all my life, but never had any
          experience writing them. It was so much fun that I bought
          his book and worked all the way through it over the course
          of just a few weeks. I am the kind of person who has to
          do something by hand in order to truly understand it.
          Which is why when I discovered <a href="http://coffeescript.org">CoffeeScript</a>
          this past October I decided that the best way to learn it
          and at the same time get to write some video games was to take
          simpleGame.js completely apart and put it all back together again in this new language.

          Working Examples
        </h1>

        <p>
          Included here is a list of a few basic proofs of concept. My hope is that
          these small pieces may one day come together and become a fully functioning game.
          The source code is included directly on the page, so you can look at it as
          you're playing with the examples
          <ul>
            <li><a href="./examples/timerDemo.html">A Timer class Demonstration</a></li>
            <li><a href="./examples/heroicMinority.html">A Sound class Demonstration</a></li>

            Updates Coming Soon
        </h1>
        
        <p>
            I have spent the last few weeks working on the engine update branch, and I'm
            finally to the point where I feel comfortable merging it into the master branch.
            My next goal is to completely redo the website and include up-to-date documentation
            and a few tutorials to help people get started. More long term, I am also looking to
            release the Greenhorn Gaming Engine as an npm package. To learn more about that,
            check out the milestone 
            <a href='http://github.com/sedabull/Greenhorn/milestones/Release npm package v-0.1.0'>
            here</a>

          Using the Engine
        </h1>

        <p>
          If you would like to use the Greenhorn Gaming Engine to create your own games, all you must do
          is download the files in lib/ and include them in your webpage like this:
        </p>

        <code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/GreenhornStyle.css"&gt;</code><br/>
        <code>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/Greenhorn.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>
        
        <p>
          Some rough documentation can be found
          <a href="https://github.com/sedabull/Greenhorn/wiki/API">here</a>.
          Please forgive it's incompleteness, just like this library, it's
          still a work-in-progress.
