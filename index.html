          History and Inspiration
        </h1>

        <p>
          This project is inspired and draws heavily from Andy Harris'
          <a href="http://aharrisbooks.net/h5g">simpleGame.js</a>.
          Andy was my introductory Computer Science professor at
          <a href="http://iupui.edu">IUPUI</a>. Over the course of
          a semester I had an opportunity to work with Andy along
          with some of my fellow students using his simpleGame.js engine.
          I have played video games all my life, but never had any
          experience writing them. It was so much fun that I bought
          his book and worked all the way through it over the course
          of just a few weeks. I am the kind of person who has to
          do something by hand in order to truly understand it.
          Which is why when I discovered <a href="http://coffeescript.org">CoffeeScript</a>
          this past October I decided that the best way to learn it
          and at the same time get to write some video games was to take
          simpleGame.js completely apart and put it all back together again in this new language.

          Working Examples

        <p>
          Included here is a list of a few basic proofs of concept. My hope is that
          these small pieces may one day come together and become a fully functioning game.

          Using the Engine
        </h1>

        <p>
          If you would like to use the Greenhorn Gaming Engine to create your own games, all you must do
          is download the file lib/Greenhorn.js and include it in your webpage like this:
        </p>

        <code>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/Greenhorn.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>
        
        <p>
          Some rough documentation can be found
          <a href="https://github.com/sedabull/Greenhorn/wiki/API">here</a>.
          Please forgive it's incompleteness, just like this library, it's
          still a work-in-progress.
