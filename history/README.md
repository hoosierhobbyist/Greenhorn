Greenhorn Inspiration
=====================

Included in this directory is the inspiration for the Greenhorn Gaming Engine. Full credit goes to Andy Harris,
who can be contacted at aharrisbooks.net. The core principal behind the simpleGame engine, is that anyone, regardless
of their programming experience, should be able to create a video game. I love this idea, and the simpleGame engine,
which is why I decided to rewrite the engine from the ground up in a new language, CoffeeScript. The one fault I could 
find with the simpleGame engine is that it's written in JavaScript. Powerful though the language may be,
I don't believe it to be a language for beginners. CoffeeScript is much more human readable, and I believe it makes it
much easier for anyone to simply look at the source to see what's going on. And the best part is, it compiles 
directly into JavaScript! My hope is that this project will eventually reach a point of reasonable stability and
cross-platform compatability, that any person with an interest in programming can pick up this library and 
start making games in no time, no matter how experienced they may be.
