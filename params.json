{"name":"Greenhorn","tagline":"An HTML5 canvas based gaming engine written in CoffeeScript.","body":"Greenhorn Gaming Engine\r\n=======================\r\n\r\nThis project started out as a simple excersise in learning CoffeeScript.\r\nI had previously worked with Andy Harris' simpleGame.js (included in history/)\r\nand I decided to rewrite it in CS. It quickly became an obsession, and now I am\r\npublishing it here, in the hopes that it will continue to grow into something amazing.\r\n\r\nWorking Examples\r\n================\r\n\r\nFor the time being you can check out a few working examples at https://cs.iupui.edu/~sedabull.\r\nI hope to have a more permanent website with demonstrations soon!\r\n\r\nUsing the Engine\r\n================\r\n\r\nIf you would like to use the Greenhorn Gaming Engine to create your own games, all you must do\r\nis download the file Greenhorn/lib/Greenhorn.js and include it in your webpage like this:\r\n```\r\n<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n<html>\r\n  <head>\r\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"path/to/Greenhorn.js\"></script>\r\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n      //set up the environment\r\n      env.IMAGE_PATH = \"path/to/images/\"; //etc.\r\n      \r\n      //name your objects as globally available\r\n      var sprite1, sprite2, textbox1; //etc.\r\n      \r\n      //the init function is called by the body onload\r\n      function init() {\r\n        //initialize objects\r\n        sp1 = new Sprite(); //etc\r\n        \r\n        //do any document specific setup\r\n        myDiv = document.getElementById(\"myDiv\"); //etc\r\n        \r\n        //start the engine (very important)\r\n        Greenhorn.start();\r\n      }//end init\r\n      \r\n      //your own personal update function is called once per frame\r\n      function update() {\r\n        //handle events here\r\n        if(keyDown[KEYS.UP]) {\r\n          //do something\r\n        }//end if\r\n        if(sprite1.collidesWith(sprite2)) {\r\n          //do something\r\n        }//end if\r\n        //etc.\r\n  </head>\r\n  <body onload=\"init()\">\r\n    <div id=\"myDiv\"></div>\r\n  </body>\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
