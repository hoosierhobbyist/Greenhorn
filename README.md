Greenhorn Gaming Engine
=======================

This project started out as a simple excersise in learning CoffeeScript.
I had previously worked with Andy Harris' simpleGame.js (included in history/)
and I decided to rewrite it in CS. It quickly became an obsession, and now I am
publishing it here, in the hopes that it will continue to grow into something amazing.
