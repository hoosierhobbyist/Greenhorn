### The Greenhorn Gaming Engine
This is an experimental gaming engine based on Andy Harris' [`simpleGame.js`](http://aharrisbooks.net/h5g). It should not be considered stable, but my hope is that over the course of a few months, while working on this in my spare time, it will become something presentable. For now, the only documentation is the source code itself. I do apologize, but I keep changing my mind on a number of different things, and trying to keep up with my fickleness would just be too much work. If you're interested, you are more than welcome to read over it and email me any questions you have at sedabull@gmail.com.
