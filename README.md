So Why Greenhorn?
=================

A *greenhorn* is an untrained or inexperienced person, and that's exactly who this library is written for. I myself am a greenhorn when it comes to both game programming and CoffeeScript (the language this library is written in), so it only seemed natural to call a gaming library written by a greenhorn for other greenhorns **The Greenhorn Gaming Engine** (creative I know). The idea here is that anyone with very minimal web design knowledge should be able to sit down and in just a few hours create their very own video game. The philosophy and design of this library are borrowed directly from the author of the [simpleGame.js](http://aharrisbooks.net/h5g) gaming engine, Andy Harris. Andy is the introductory Computer Science professor at [IUPUI](http://iupui.edu), where I attend classes. If you'd like to understand how I got started on this project, you should check out his book *HTML5 Game Development for Dummies*. It's a great introductory resource and is the  foundation upon which I've built this engine.

Working Examples
================

The official website can be found [here](http://sedabull.github.io/Greenhorn). There are several working examples up and running, which have just recently recieved a *major* facelift. That style is what I plan to implement across the entire web site.

Using the Engine
================

If you would like to use the Greenhorn Gaming Engine to create your own games, all you must do
is download the files in lib/ and include them in your webpage like this:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/GreenhornStyle.css">
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/Greenhorn.js"></script>
```
Some rough documentation can be found [here](http://github.com/sedabull/Greenhorn/wiki/API). Please keep in mind though that the documentation, along with everything else about this library, is still very much a work in progress.
